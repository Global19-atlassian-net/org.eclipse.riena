This folder contains the ´stage fragments´.
Each fragment defines a stage by a set of string variable substitutions (IStringVariablManager).
These variables are used in several configuration data (extensions) and will be replaced with
their definitions in the stage.
To activate a stage you have to checkout (CVS perspective) a fragment and add to your launch description.
